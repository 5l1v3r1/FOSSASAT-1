TODO
----
	- Write an interface for receving serial values on the ground station
		- Serial read -> parse function id -> if statements to route to correct booleans.
		
	- Create a nodejs application:
		- Routes all serial reading through websockets to javascript webpage.
		- Routes all button commands through websockets to serial write.




General
--------
	- Log the values into a text file. (LOCAL)
	- Display solar cell mV and battery charging values over time. (LOCAL)
	- If we are receiving values from the satellite, post the entire packet to a webserver and save it with the time received. (REMOTE)
		- Write to file JSON database. (REMOTE)
		
	- Ground Station booleans must be able to be switched.
	- Ground Station never sends a custom message to the satellite (*)
	- The satellite sends custom messages back (*)
	- One way messaging from ground station.





System infomation page (LOCAL)
---------------------
Data to display:
	- 6 mV
	- 1 mA
	- 1 Counter
	- 1 Boolean
	
Elements:
	- 6 
	- Google Charts Line Chart that represent mV and mA over time.
		
		
Specifications:
	- solar cell volages are sent in mV.
	- solar cell voltage range 0.45V to 4.2V.
		






Control page (LOCAL)
------------
Elements:
	- Rich text box for received messages from satellite.
	- Rich text box for sent commands from ground station.
	- Button array of simple commands.
	
Control system (INTERNAL)
--------------
- Every message sent from the control panel is first validated and verified to be ok.
- If the messages passes V&V filters it is serial.wrote.
	
	
	
	

		
Webserver packet system (INTERNAL)
-----------------------
Description:
	- send entire serial.read string as a POST to our PHP website.
	- PHP website then adsd it to a database.

Libraries:
	- https://github.com/cybrox/crunchdb - JSON database.
