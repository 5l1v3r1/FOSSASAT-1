The full specific aspects of the functionality of the payload still need to be determined, the main processor however will be an Atmega 2561 along with an SX1278 LoRa transmitter  along with a variety of sensors that will be used, the main idea is to allow people to contribute with their full code to the mission and be able to fly their code. For this reason the atmega 2561 was chosen allowing us to increase the amount of sketches.
