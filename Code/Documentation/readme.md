### Update
Completed the above targets. I am now using Doxygen to document the code and tasks and todo lists.

When I commit new updates, I plan to track them with the different versions of the doxygen html documentation.

### TO start understanding the code, please read the Flow Charts given in /Flow charts/ for an overview and then read through the doxygen html documentation.
